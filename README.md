# The Image Viewer
<br />
<br />
This app was created to display images on web browsers, it includes three main functionalities that work only when using a mouse:
<br />
<br />
1- Zooming in/out: this is done using the scroll wheel of the mouse.
<br />
2- Panning the image: by clicking and dragging a zoomed-in image.
<br />
3- Restoring the default position of the image: by double clicking a zoomed-in image, making the image fit inside the window of the web browser.
<br />
<br />
On devices with a touch screen, those functionalities are present by default, therefore the app ignores any touch events.
