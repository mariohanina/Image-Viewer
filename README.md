# The Image Viewer


<pre>
This app was created to display images on web browsers, it includes three main functionalities:

1- Zooming in/out: this is done using the scroll wheel of the mouse.
2- Panning the image: by clicking and dragging a zoomed-in image.
3- Restoring the default position of the image: making the image fit inside the window of the web browser.

On devices with a touch screen, those functionalities are present by default, therefore the app ignores any touch events.
